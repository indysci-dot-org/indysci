public documents for indysci dot org


Pursuant to discussions from the February 2013 board meeting of indysci dot org, the purpose of this repository 
is to create a second public backup of indysci files (as of 2013 the primary files are currently stored with google
drive services).

Anyone wishing to found a nonprofit should feel free to fork this repository and use our documents as a template
for nonprofit operations.  Especially science-oriented nonprofits may find our documents useful.
